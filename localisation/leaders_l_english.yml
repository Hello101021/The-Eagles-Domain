 POLITICS_GEORGE_V_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§!\nJune 3, 1865\nLondon, United Kingdom\n§W--------------§!\nThe life of King George V has been one filled with radical change for both the world and the British Empire. Born during the reign of his grandmother Queen Victoria, the premature death of his elder brother led to George being placed directly in line for the throne. At the time of his crowning in 1910, the British Empire stood as the most powerful nation on the planet, with its influence only looking to grow. But this wouldn’t be.\n\nOn August 4, 1914, the British Empire declared war on the German Empire after its invasion of Belgium, drawing the nation into the Great War. While hopes for the Entente were high at first, as the war progressed the situation grew bleaker with the declaration of war by the United States as the final nail in the Entente coffin. Through this George V watched with horror as the mighty empire his ancestors built crumbled under the weight of the Central Powers. The resulting peace treaty tore the nation apart as colonial territories were stripped and reparations imposed. The king’s efforts to keep the public spirit high with the support of establishment political parties proved unsuccessful with a public turn to radicalism. This came to a boiling power with the 1926 General Strike resulting in the takeover by the British Fascists.\n\n1936 finds the king a very tired and old man. Wary of the BFP and their radical calls to restore Britain, George proceeded to self isolate himself amongst the various royal holdings. While many members of the political establishment looked to the king as a means to end the Fascist upstarts, these calls fell on deaf ears. Given up and defeated the king looks to be at the end of his lifespan. With almost all royal duties performed by Prince Edward, many citizens even forget the last time they’ve seen the king."
